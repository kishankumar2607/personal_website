        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I was born in Darbhanga, Bihar. The historical and cultural heritage
            of Darbhanga establishes this place on the tourism map. The fort,
            palace, and numerous buildings and temples constructed by Maharaja
            Kameshwar Singh are major attractions in the city.
          </p>
          <p class="second-description">
            Currently, I am pursuing a PG Diploma in Web Development at
            Conestoga College. With a Bachelor's in Computer Applications from
            Gujarat University, my technical expertise lies in creating seamless
            web and mobile experiences using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hobbies include playing cricket, coding, and listening to music.
            Coding is my top interest, where I enjoy tackling problems and
            building innovative solutions. I also love cricket, and discovering
            new music keeps me creative and motivated.
